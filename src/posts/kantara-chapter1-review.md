Watched Kantara Chapter 1 in theatre with my girlfriend on 18th. What a great movie! I usually like watching movies related to tradition, history, etc. This was one great movie with great vfx, action, dialogues and music. Rishabh has acted so well in the entire movie. The story took a bit of time to build, but the climax scenes were goated. If you're a fan of Indian traditions and culture, trust me you will love this movie. The fiery dances and roars are bone chilling. A few of the scenes look like they are similar to scenes from RRR. I haven't watched Kantara (2022), so that's next.\
Do I recommend? 100% yes. But I'm no professional reviewer so take my words with carefulness haha.
